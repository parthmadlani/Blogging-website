            <h2>Types of Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>
                    <li>Supervised Learning: In this type of machine learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, where the input and output are known. 
                        It learns from the labeled examples to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.</li>
                    <li>Unsupervised Learning: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. 
                        The algorithm learns patterns and structures in the data without any predefined labels. It is used for tasks like clustering,
                        dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.</li>
                    <li>Reinforcement Learning: This type of machine learning involves an agent interacting with an environment and learning through trial and error. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions,
                        and it aims to maximize the cumulative reward over time.</li>
                    <li>Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on artificial neural networks with multiple layers. It is capable of learning complex patterns and representations from large amounts of data, and it has achieved remarkable success in areas like image recognition and natural language processing.</li>
